Aside from the obvious components that can be stripped out and used elsewhere (such as the cavalcade en route, cavalcade encamped, Nebulan Chapterhouse and the Caldeth Townhouse) there are other uses for the adventure material.</p>\n<p>Background Activities. Nothing makes a campaign seem more real than to have large, interesting events happening in the background that have nothing to do with your current adventure. Have your PCs encounter the Earl’s retinue on the main road while they are going somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Manor/Keep/Castle en route: For some reason (broken wagon wheel, injury, brigands) the Earl and his retinue have been forced off their planned course and end up at the PC’s manor. They need food and shelter for the night, for sixty if you please.</p>\n<p>Render Aid: The Earl and his knights are off hunting when brigands attack. The PCs come across the wagon train hard pressed by the criminals. If they render aid, the Earl will be very appreciative.</p>\n<p>Fellow Travellers: The PCs are travelling along the road when they encounter the Earl and his retinue travelling the same direction. There have been reports of brigands ahead and the Earl offers to allow the PCs to join his party for mutual protection.</p>\n<p>Brigands/Sneak Thieves: The Earl “treasure wagon” is carrying gold, jewelry, usurer’s notes and well over £600 in silver pennies. It is the ultimate prize for those with the élan or skill to take on an Earl, his knights and men-at-arms. A heist like this would be the coup of the century, on par with the theft of the Sword of Calsten. Are the PCs desperate or foolish enough to attack the personal caravan of a peer of the realm?</p>\n<p>Spies/Assassins: The PCs are in the employ of one of the Earl’s many enemies (see @UUID[JournalEntry.1jJR0PqDGXtjve3L.JournalEntryPage.Vd4WYNCooMZMxhmS]{The Enemy} for ideas). They have not been able to get close to him while he was holed up in Minarsas Castle. Now that he is on the road, he is vulnerable. They are ordered to infiltrate the retinue and discover its true purpose and report back. They may be required to steal or sabotage something or kill someone, perhaps the Earl himself.</p>\n<p>Mistaken Identity. There are rumours of brigands in the area.

In particular, I was motivated to write this campaign module for three reasons: to show what a noble’s entourage might look like, to provide (in my opinion) a truly Hârnic style adventure and to give GMs a good opportunity to use all those castle articles that have been filling up their binders.</p>\n<p>There have been several discussions on the HârnForum about noble’s entourages. How big are they? What are they composed of? James Sawyer’s post (AKA maypole) asking “someone” to write up such an entourage was an appeal to my ego I found hard to resist. I am no medieval expert, but I had a few ideas drawn from various books I own. So I sketched out an entourage and conned my good buddy Thomas Shook into drawing it up for me.</p>\n<p>I could have just released the entourage as a four-page article, but then I started thinking about who was in it. I choose an Earl, because I like big groups and started detailing the retinue. Then, this led me to start to think about which Earl it should be and where he was going. One thing led to another and I started to map out a route. From there, the idea of adding PCs and making it an adventure just came naturally.</p>\n<p>Hârn desperately needs new adventures. It is a beautiful background, but there are few published adventures and they lack the right tone. Why create an interesting, realistic and magic-rare world and then have all your published adventures involve magic or supernatural creatures? I have to credit (or blame!) John Sgammato with planting the idea in my head to create a real epic campaign where there are tons of action and cool adventures thoroughly grounded in realism. The drama and excitement of this adventure come from realistic people with believable motivations doing rational things using mundane (but still deadly) methods.</p>\n<p>Another reason for creating this adventure was to get PCs into the castles. Roy Denton (AKA redenton) made a comment that struck home with me, as a CGI and fan fiction author. He said, as a GM, he had rarely used any of Hârn’s many castles. I thought about that long and hard and realised, he was right. Why? Because as authors, we had never given him, as a GM, a compelling reason to go into them. So, I deliberately structured The Earl’s Progress to kick open those doors and now I invite the PCs and GMs to take advantage of all those great castle locations that are waiting to be used. Minarsas, Qualdris, Tashal and Olokand are vital pieces of this adventure. The PCs will have to visit them now. Once that door is open and they have contacts in all of these places, hopeful it will be hard to stop them from wanting to return again and again.</p>\n<p>John Sgammato has been my mentor and cheerleader throughout this process. We spent many long evenings chatting on the phone. He is the idea man behind the map with Hârndex style entries facing it, the calendars, the layout with room for GM notes on the side, the rumour tables and dozens of other small, but extraordinarily helpful, interesting and useful bits here and there. Without him, this adventure would not have been half as interesting.</p>\n<p>Joe Adams has been my “big picture” guy, evaluating the overall ebb and flow of the adventure and making a number of key recommendations and observations, which hopefully have made the module more exciting. Dan Bell is my canon-god. He has patiently scrutinized the module from end to end utilizing his encyclopaedic knowledge of Hârn to check every detail. However, any residual errors remain my responsibility. Andy Gibson is a great sounding board and was a vital assistant to help me get the right tone for the Social Status section.</p>\n<p>As always, Richard Luschek has been a key agent in translating my words into Harnic images. His vision and ability to capture the “look and feel” of Hârn makes all the difference to me. Thomas Shook has taken over from Patrick Nilsson and Jocke Andersson as my regular mapper. Those are big shoes to fill and his has done it skillfully, quickly and without complaint (even when I put him under totally unreasonable deadlines!).</p>\n<p>In the end, I wrote this module, because it is what I wanted and couldn’t find. It took on a life of its own and just started to grow (and grow and GROW…). I hope I have succeeded in telling a good story, only time and the response of HârnFans will tell. I hope you (the reader and hopefully the GM) find it interesting and useful. May it spawn many long days of enjoyable Hârnic gaming.

He rarely stirs from his lair, and then only for the briefest of periods. Thus, his subjects were shocked when he announced his intention to make a great tour of the realm. He will visit his liegeman, the Baron of Kolorn and his Constables at Zoben and Baseta, attend the Royal Chelebin Tournament of Chivalry at Olokand Castle and stop at the capital city of Tashal en route.</p>\n<p>All of Vemionshire is abuzz with the news. The Earl will host a tournament in Minarsas. The winners will join his retinue and represent the shire at the Olokand tourney. Every knight and yeoman is vying for a spot in this once-in-a-lifetime tour of the kingdom and with it, the promise of the personal favor of one of the most powerful magnates in Kaldor. Are you worthy of being a member of The Earl’s Progress?</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Medieval lords travelled a great deal. This was necessary for them to administrate their far-flung fiefdoms and to communicate with their lord, liegemen, friends and family. However, such a trip was not undertaken by just a handful of people travelling vast distances quickly, rather it was an entire household, including family members, guards, servants, staff, animals, wagons and furniture unhurriedly traversing the realm. This was a leisurely age, of slow travel and even slower communications, so those who could afford it preferred to relax and make it an enjoyable experience. The arrival of such a cavalcade was a major event in medieval life and often the primary source of news and information for remote corners of the realm.</p>\n<p>It is well known that Sir Declaen Caldeth, 19th Earl of Vemion, does not enjoy travel. He visits his holdings in Vemionshire once a year and each autumn meets the King in Kolorn to deliver his annual feudal payment. His customary route is to travel to Nenda, then down the Selene River to Uldien where his widowed sister lives. He then travels to Kolorn to visit his vassal, Baron Bastune.</p>\n<p>He rests uneasy when his obligations take him away from Minarsas, [Sgammato, John, et al. 2005. Minarsas. Columbia Games Inc. Currently in print, available from CGI: Minarsas.] in part due to his inability to delegate and the immaturity of his son and heir. Thus, many people were shocked when, during the Minarsas Wool Fair [Minarsas. The Minarsas Wool Fair. Pages 33-39.] 5-9 Kelen 720TR, the Earl announced that in just two weeks he would host a tournament in Minarsas and the winners would accompany him to Olokand [Crossby, N. Robin et al. 1986. Kaldor Kingdom Module (Version 1). Olokand Castle. Pages 1-8. Columbia Games Inc. Out of print, sometimes available on eBay.]  [Crossby, N. Robin et al. 2003. Olokand Castle (Version 2). Columbia Games Inc. Currently in print, available from CGI: Olokand.] and the great Royal Chelebin Tournament [Olokand v2. The Royal Chelebin Tournament of Chivalry. Pages 25-34.] that summer. This is unheard of. The Earl is planning a great “Progress” through the kingdom. Rumours and theories abound. Why is he going to Olokand? Only the Earl knows for sure.</p>\n<h2>Objective</h2>\n<p>The objective of this adventure is as individual as the PCs that will play it. Overall, the adventure is the story of a trip. A great magnate leaves his secure fortress and travels across the kingdom, visiting his liegemen and presenting himself at the King’s court. Depending on their role within his entourage and rank (noble, guided, common) there are a variety of different adventures the PCs can participate in. The GM is also encouraged to add his own ideas and adventures into the campaign to integrate this module into their own on-going story line.</p>\n<h2>Lead-Ins</h2>\n<p>There are many different lead-ins for this adventure. GMs are encouraged to find logical and believable ways of incorporating existing PCs from their own campaign into the Earl’s retinue. For GMs seeking inspiration or starting the campaign with new characters, there is an extensive pre-game section with suggestions (see @UUID[JournalEntry.QK1ZfRBCXd5Uc13L.JournalEntryPage.uJScEbqcDg3c0sTY]{Pregame}). In addition, a large number of pre-generated characters are available in Friends, Foes and Followers. [Mould, Kerry, et al. 2005-2006. Friends, Foes and Followers Parts 17. Fan Fiction.

It involves the highest levels of Kaldoric nobility and swirls with intrigue. The GM can reasonably involve any location along that general route.</p>\n<p>The retinue travels at the rate of 4 leagues per watch (2.5 mph or 4 km/h), the speed of a loaded wagon on an unpaved road in flat country. It takes place over a period of about two months. Since the Earl’s objective is to attend the Royal Chelebin Tournament of Chivalry in Olokand during the second ten-day of Larane, the adventure must take place in the summer time.</p>\n<p>This adventure is specifically tailored for the Earl of Vemion. However, the concept can be easily adapted for another Earl, Baron, Archbishop or Bishop with the creation of a new itinerary based on this campaign. The premise is to draw a route allowing the lord to visit several key locations, finally ending up in Tashal for the Summer Fair and then traveling to Olokand for the tournament.</p>\n<p>The adventure can also be adapted for other kingdoms. The GM chooses a lord and a destination and develops the itinerary for one to get to the other. The key element of this adventure is the trip, though the destination can result in a whole new crop of adventures.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Consistency is one of the hallmarks of Hârn. To assist with this, The Earl’s Progress uses internal cross-references throughout. It also has an extensive list of external references marked by footnote numbers. HWG prides itself on being consistent with both official publications (referred to as canon) and fan fiction (referred to as fanon) as much as possible. We hope that these references will make the GM’s job of finding the relevant primary sources easier and encourages you to check out the excellent work produced by other HârnFans and Columbia Games Inc.</p>\n<h2>Campaign Outline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.QK1ZfRBCXd5Uc13L.JournalEntryPage.4wbTlLTfkE8MwepB]{Route Map}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.MqjeECrAV49ivzRH]{Route Map Key}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.1jJR0PqDGXtjve3L.JournalEntryPage.tt9qVXEpznIIozww]{Background}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.ea3G4LCifXW5g6Mr]{The Earl's Cavalcade}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.1NKEj979bodby8bp.JournalEntryPage.1NCbi5SPE4DOf90d]{Roleplaying Opportunities}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.IkPLc6H5gNQYTQua.JournalEntryPage.244Pdf2dcAzO3317]{Cavalcade Enroute}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.T8l2xm09Pm6nFofT.JournalEntryPage.s4l4WtUvvoo6JkYX]{Cavalcade Encamped}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.FGMeOLJquHoNOAAG.JournalEntryPage.y5qjHlvpxGDVtPuk]{Rumours}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.QK1ZfRBCXd5Uc13L.JournalEntryPage.gQJdSx6aPBbRZsLe]{Campaign Notes and Adventure Hooks}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.1NKEj979bodby8bp.JournalEntryPage.1DmpZrL1CWP1XcTi]{Alternate Uses for this Module}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.1NKEj979bodby8bp.JournalEntryPage.QYdtBvalSV08U25L]{The Crown Prince of Melderyn (Prince's Progress)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.1NKEj979bodby8bp.JournalEntryPage.iBuqFLRsLi0Nxvhb]{Author’s Note}</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"_id":"QZx4DlrOCFXa8gaa","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":-100000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}}],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"hm3","systemVersion":"1.4.0","coreVersion":"10.276","createdTime":1659201858907,"modifiedTime":1659201858907,"lastModifiedBy":"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW"},"_id":"1NKEj979bodby8bp","ownership":{"default":0,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"folder":null,"sort":0}

No self-respecting lord or bailiff would allow a Peer of the Realm to sleep in a pavilion or stay at an inn when their manor house was available. It would be unheard of. Lords bend over backwards for their honoured guests, including vacating their own rooms for the Earl’s use and providing fine accommodations for his entourage. Most nights, the Earl will be accommodated at a manor rather than camping in the “rough”.</p>\n<p>The knowledge of a person’s seniority within the kingdom is vital. The most senior person will get the best of everything. There is no concept of first-come-first-served. If the Earl arrived late, after all of the rooms and beds had been allocated, other guests would be displaced to ensure he had the best of everything, no matter the hour or the inconvenience.</p>\n<p>However, it is just good courtesy to advise your hosts of your impending arrival to ensure they can prepare. A courier or messenger rides several hours ahead of the retinue. He informs the destination of the rank and number of guests en route so preparations can be made. Usually a large meal will be prepared.</p>\n<p>Guests are not expected to pay for anything. Meals and accommodation are provided without expectation of compensation. The food the retinue eats and the grain and fodder the retinue’s stock consumes can be a significant burden on any fief they visit. In recognition of this, it is also good courtesy for a guest to present a gift to their host on departure. This can include clothes, jewelry, horses and other gifts in kind. It will almost never include silver coin. This would demean the host and imply they were nothing more than a common innkeeper.</p>\n<p>One of the side benefits of providing hospitality is a return invitation. A polite guest will invite their host to visit them at their fief. An invitation to Minarsas Castle and dinner with the Earl are worth substantial prestige and bragging rights. For a knight with only one manor, the opportunity to attend the Earl’s court is one to be treasured. A large progress such as the Earl’s will spawn many smaller knights’ progress’ to Minarsas.</p>\n<p>The route of The Earl’s Progress is quite deliberate. Small manor houses lack the space and facilities to host such a large entourage and the financial impact can be devastating. Consequently, the chamberlain has chosen to make most stops at keeps, castles and abbeys. They are well able to accommodate the sixty-plus guests of the Earl’s party. When a stop over at a manor is unavoidable, the first choice is one of the Earl’s own manors. If nothing is available, then the cavalcade will impose on the manor of another lord. Sir Declaen is scrupulous about giving substantial gifts in thanks for the hospitality. Not all nobles are so considerate. Because of his wealth and reputation for largess, the Earl of Vemion will be welcomed with open arms whereever he chooses to stop.</p>","format":1},"_id":"Wz1SyxqSIh7SGLsY","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Lady Ialny's Wagon Image","src":"modules/hm-cpn-earlsprogress/assets/images/lady-ialnys-wagon.webp","type":"image","image":{"caption":"Lady Ialny's Wagon"},"_id":"YbwesnfytmycGyJf","text":{"format":1},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Lady Ialny's Wagon","src":"modules/hm-cpn-earlsprogress/assets/images/lady-ialnys-wagon.webp","type":"text","image":{"caption":"Lady Ialny's Wagon"},"_id":"IjBXfpvwSIRob0Vp","text":{"content":"<p><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"modules/hm-cpn-earlsprogress/assets/images/lady-ialnys-wagon.webp\" /></p>","format":1},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Minarsas in the Earl’s Absence","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>The Earl plans to be gone for about two months, in his absence he will be forced (much to his displeasure) to delegate control of his Earldom.

What is it about this adventure that should compel them to join the Earl’s entourage? Aside from the obvious concept of adventuring for adventuring’s sake, there are several compelling reasons to participate in The Earl’s Progress.</p>\n<p>The Earl of Vemion is a powerful man. Inclusion in his retinue is a sign of great favour and can lead to many opportunities: financial, political and personal. The Earl and his followers will be travelling across the realm in a large, well-protected wagon train, giving the PCs a rare opportunity to see the kingdom from one end to another and interact at its highest levels. Their time in Tashal will give them a great opportunity to take advantage of the Summer Fair, while the trip to Olokand will allow them a chance to participate in the greatest tournament on Hârn. In essence, being the member of a great noble household will open doors frequently closed to lowly, disreputable adventurers. The potential for many exciting spin-off adventures is tremendous. Fame and fortune await!</p>\n<p>As members of a noble’s retinue, the GM will be able to ignore the costs of day-to-day life and concentrate on adventuring. If the Earl chooses to use the PCs as agents (and they are successful), then they can expect substantial rewards, including silver, weapons, armour, permanent positions in his household and even (in exceptional circumstances) a position as a bailiff on one of his manors. If all goes well, Sir Andro Valador’s position as bailiff of Wynlis Manor will likely be vacant by the end of the adventure, a lucrative prize indeed.</p>\n<p>The Earl’s Progress is more than a simple one-night dungeon crawl. It is a campaign. A vast series of interconnected events and adventures which can occupy years of gaming or just a few weeks, depending on how it is played. For the players, this allows them to completely immerse their characters in the world that is Kaldor on Hârn. There are excellent opportunities for character development, skill improvement and gaining valuable contacts. For GMs, it provides an established framework with villains, motivations, locations and adventures already mapped out, ready and waiting to be played.</p>","format":1},"_id":"yy4T4q6wDAbLddV3","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":375000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Position within the Cavalcade","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>As indicated in @UUID[JournalEntry.1jJR0PqDGXtjve3L.JournalEntryPage.yrG6yIZDcYv4sqlb]{Social Status}, a person’s physical location within the entourage is very important. Other clues (such as: whether they are walking, riding or being carried in a wagon; what type of clothes they wear; and what their body language and their speech patterns say) combine to communicate considerable information to anyone they meet, long before they are introduced. Thus, sending the wrong signals, such as wearing too fine a clothes, riding when you should be walking or acting noble when you are common can be extremely confusing and will not be tolerated.</p>\n<p>Depending on the outcome of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QK1ZfRBCXd5Uc13L.JournalEntryPage.uJScEbqcDg3c0sTY]{Pregame}, there may be additional members of the entourage not shown on the Cavalcade Enroute diagram (see @UUID[JournalEntry.IkPLc6H5gNQYTQua.JournalEntryPage.244Pdf2dcAzO3317]{Cavalcade Enroute}). In general, they will fall into one of the following five categories: Earl’s inner circle/guests, lesser nobles/retainers, senior commoners/guildsmen, soldiers or staff/servants. Before the entourage departs, the GM (in the role of the chamberlain) should assign them positions within the travelling entourage, as appropriate. If the PCs are senior enough, this could be a point of negotiation (see @UUID[JournalEntry.QK1ZfRBCXd5Uc13L.JournalEntryPage.FHfYN6pMIm6AMUCZ#place-means-status-(noble)]{Place Means Status (Noble)}).</p>\n<p>A similar exercise will have to be undertaken to assign accommodations. If noble, room will be made for the PCs in one of the pavilions or they will get some sort of room when visiting another noble. If they are a senior common retainer or soldier, they can sleep in one of the wagons or on the floor of their host’s hall. If they are servants, they will have to scrounge whatever they can, perhaps a spot under a wagon or in a barn.</p>\n<p>Since status is variable, the GM should allow the PCs to occasionally “renegotiate” their position as the adventure progresses (if they do well). He should equally feel free to “demote” them when they screw up.</p>\n<p>The chain of command within the entourage is relatively fixed, stemming from the Earl’s ultimate authority, down through the chamberlain to the guests and servants. However, there will be occasions where the Earl, chamberlain and captain are absent. Most of the time, the chamberlain will appoint a deputy caravan master in his stead. This will be based mostly on rank and seniority. If the senior person is unable to fulfil the position or has screwed it up badly on previous occasions, the chamberlain may pass over them to select a more competent leader (perhaps a PC). The deputy caravan leader will then have to tread carefully when dealing with the passed over individual.</p>\n<p>In the absence of nobles (members of the household or guests), the next most senior in command will be a member of the Earl’s permanent household. Ebran of Harabor is senior and well trusted. Members of the Wyvern Guard are next. The Earl’s huntsman, falconer and scribe follow them. However, if for some reason (incompetence or panic) the senior individual present fails to act in an urgent situation, there is an opportunity for a strong leader to step forward and assume command. In a crisis, the other servants may look to PCs who are skilled, experienced and trusted by the Earl or chamberlain. Success will be well rewarded; failure equally well punished.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"_id":"paL77rUNfkm4vnLK","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":475000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Social Status","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>There is a strict hierarchy within the retinue that shall be respected at all times. The phrase “familiarity breeds contempt” is taken very seriously on Hârn. Those who presume to act above their station or fail to show proper respect to their “betters” will be severely punished. In no particular order, punishments include: scolding, striking (slap, cuff, kick, punch, riding crop, etc.), additional duties, pillory, fine, flogging, dismissal, removal of the tongue (considered extreme, it is rare outside of Rethem) and banishment (or combinations and variations thereof).</p>\n<p>An indication of a person’s position within the hierarchy is their proximity to the Earl, so promotion (or demotion) within the pecking order quickly becomes obvious. This trickles down to whether people ride or walk, where they sit and sleep, when and how much food they receive and what tasks they are assigned. Because this is not fixed, it can change dramatically over time. The Earl’s personal staff has regular access to his presence in the conduct of their duties, which is a significant added advantage.</p>\n<p>The chamberlain is the overall enforcer of the noble/common hierarchy. However, all nobles and superiors are expected to (and will) act immediately to correct an overly familiar or cheeky subordinate. A cuff upside the head is enough to raise a good bruise or welt (a blunt strike in HM terms) and serves as a nice reminder and warning to others. Within the commoner ranks, enforcement of the hierarchy is governed “unofficially” and is more often based on an individual’s power, muscle, or ability to intimidate rather than their rank.</p>\n<p>The Earl will be referred to as My Lord, Your Lordship or (at the very minimum) Sir. Equals or superiors may refer to him in the third person simply as Vemion (short form for “Earl of”). All knights and their spouses will be referred to as Sir or Lady (or Dame, if a female knight). Minor nobles (under 21) are referred to as Maid or Master (including Camissa and Mikha). The chaplain is referred to as Matakea; he is noble and has more latitude than most in dealing with his superiors (with the exception of the Earl). He may act familiar to inferiors; they may not reciprocate. Nobles address commoners by their first names. Lower ranking commoners address guildsmen by their title and name (master, journeyman, apprentice).</p>\n<p>Time and place also matter in affairs of respect and forms of address. It may be fine for a childhood friend to be more familiar with the Earl in the privacy of his chambers, but in a public place he becomes just 'one of the crowd' as far as treatment goes. Friends of nobility realise and work with this, staying humble and respectful in company but telling them what they really think in private, making for some interesting intrigues.</p>\n<p>The remaining members of the entourage are freemen. The nobles lump them together, but even within their number there is a clear ranking. A guildsmen’s status is based on their position within the household, their rank within their guild and their guild’s prestige (variable). Servants are the lowest rank of freemen; although, by virtue of being liveried members of an Earl’s household, they do have some seniority and prestige that sets them above common followers of lesser nobles.</p>\n<p>The captain and men-at-arms are an exception to the normal rules. They are responsible for the Earl’s life. Because of this, they have special status in situations affecting his security, placing them above all, except for the Earl and chamberlain. They work in close quarters with the nobility and have earned their positions by virtue of their ability to walk a delicate line.

He failed, was captured and died under torture before revealing who sent him. The Earl ordered security tightened and there have been no further attempts on his life. After two years, his wife’s deteriorating health and the looming Succession Crisis have forced him to undertake this Progress. In doing so, he must leave the safety and security of Minarsas Castle and web of spies and informants that have protected him these last couple of years. Once out of Vemionshire, he will be exposed. This is the opportunity his enemy has been waiting for.

He is a blueblooded noble of impeccable lineage and the long time friend of Sir Declaen. Sir Andro was slighted and dishonoured when, in 717TR, his supposed “friend” and patron chose a lowborn commoner to become Constable of Zoben Keep over him. Instead of giving this lucrative, powerful and prestigious appointment to his most loyal friend and brother of his wife, the Earl tossed it away like a bone to a jumped-up yeoman pig. Sir Andro has been left to rot as bailiff of a “pitiful” 3000-acre manor in south-eastern Vemionshire. He kept his tongue, feigning loyalty and shrugging off his ambitions, claiming the post would have been too much of a bother anyway. Secretly, he nurses a deep, burning hatred for the Earl and waits for the opportunity to reap his revenge.</p>\n<p>The Earl of Vemion routinely investigates those who work for him and dismisses any he suspects of disloyalty. [Minarsas. Earl Declaen Caldeth.] This has made it extremely difficult for the enemy to kill him. One night, after many flagons of ale, Sir Andro’s façade slipped and he railed against the injustice of it all and revealed his carefully concealed hatred for the Earl. This was just opening the enemy was searching for. Sir Andro was above reproach; no one would ever suspect him, especially not the Earl. The next day, the enemy made a carefully crafted pitch to the bailiff, appealing to his wounded ego and bruised honour. If they worked together, they could rid the world of Sir Declaen and elevate his son in his place. Surely, Sir Urian would cast out this upstart commoner and install his loyal and loving uncle in his place. It was agreed; Sir Andro will help kill the Earl.</p>\n<section class=\"highlight\">\n<p>GM Note</p>\n<p>None of the back-story or potential enemies is supported by official Hârnic references. It is entirely made up by the author. It may or may not be true. Use it or discard it as you see fit.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>Option 1 – Lady Thilisa Meleken</h3>\n<p>Lady Thilisa wants to kill her father because of her mother. Lady Ialny’s palsy is not because of an illness but because of the Earl’s actions. Lady Ialny was a strong woman and often argued with her husband over his decisions. One night, during a particularly vicious argument, Sir Declaen struck her. She fell and hit her head on the stone fireplace. The head injury has never healed, leaving her permanently trapped in her own useless body. On hearing of her mother’s “sickness” Lady Thilisa rushed to Minarsas where her brother told her what had happened.</p>\n<p>The Earl is very remorseful for his actions. He is not normally the type to strike women. It was done in the heat of the moment. Since then, he has spared no expense to save her life. He dotes on her, in part because of the extreme guilt he suffers. Many nights the thoughts of his actions will not allow him to sleep. Lady Thilisa has never forgiven her father. She is polite and civil to him in public, but in private she is angry and vengeful. She has been plotting her mother’s revenge for many years.</p>\n<p>Thilisa plans to assassinate her father and put her brother, Sir Urian, in his place. He is a pliable fool who trusts her. He already looks to her for leadership and will even more when his father is gone. She will control him like a puppet. In fact, she has a close friend whom Urian is sure to fall for (tall, blonde, with big breasts and smarter than him, just his type). Sir Urian knows nothing of the plot and would be horrified at the thought.</p>\n<p>GM Option: Lady Thilisa may have already sent assassins to ensure the Earl of Osel, Sir Sedris Meleken, never returns from his search for the murderer. This will leave Thilisa in control of both Osel and Vemion and potential Kingmaker. She favours Lady Cheselyne the Elder (another slighted woman).</p>\n<h3>Option 2 – Sheriff of Vemion</h3>\n<p>As the King’s youngest unacknowledged bastard, Sir Tulath Kaphin has a claim to the throne. Conscious of his weak position, he carefully conceals his burning ambition to be king. He has few supporters beyond his wife (daughter of the Baron of Ternua) and his mother (the powerful and mysterious Dame Erila Kaphin, King’s consort and Lord Privy Seal). The Earl of Vemion has taken pains to bring this contender under his influence, but there is a growing rivalry between these two men. The sheriff enjoys hunting with the Earl’s son, Sir Urian Caldeth. [Minarsas. Current Political Situation. Page 3.]</p>\n<p>Sir Tulath wanted a powerful appointment to match those of his bastard half-brothers: Sir Maldan Harabor (Constable of Olokand Castle and Sheriff of Meselynshire) and Sir Koris Harabor (Marshal of the Guard). Considered something of a wastrel, the King constantly delayed, claiming he was “too young.” Somewhat reformed since his recent marriage to Lady Elena Verdreth, the King relented and in 718TR made him Sheriff of the distant shire of Vemion in hopes Larani would grant him some maturity. So far, the King’s hopes have not been rewarded. Charming and optimistic, Sir Tulath lives extravagantly and is deep in debt.</p>\n<p>Far from capital or centres of influence, Sir Tulath cultivates Clan Caldeth in hopes building a power base in the south. His attempts to woo the Earl failed; Sir Declaen proved too independent and politically savvy. Undeterred, the Sheriff turned his attentions towards the Earl’s heir, Sir Urian. Young, politically inexperienced and naïve, he proved more receptive to Tulath’s charms. The sheriff plans to remove the elder Caldeth and “accelerate” his friend’s inheritance. Once Sir Urian is fully committed to his cause, Tulath intends to use him to enlist Lady Thilisa’s support. With the Earldoms of Vemion and Osel in his camp, he believes he has a real chance of securing the throne. Unaware of her son’s machinations, Dame Erila would be horrified at the chaos that could ensue if the anchor of the east were to come loose unexpectedly.</p>\n<h3>Option 3 – Eye of Krasula</h3>\n<p>In 30 Navek 716TR, three innocent young children were snatched off the roads of Zoben. Two days later, their bodies were discovered, murdered and drained of blood. The Laranian priests recognised the symbolic date and the hallmarks of the ritual murder sacrifice of the dread Navehan holy day, Shadowmath. Afraid there might be panic if it was revealed that Navehans were murdering children, they quietly appealed to the Earl for assistance.</p>\n<p>For weeks the Earl’s agents searched for signs of the dark church, until, by chance, a gong farmer emptying the keep’s cesspit overheard the constable planning the next murder and reported it to the local Laranian priest. In a swift and unexpected raid, the Earl’s men captured the constable alive. At the hands of Laranian inquisitors, he broke, revealing he was a Navehan cleric and naming his acolytes. They were quietly arrested and hung. The courageous and battle-tested Sir Coreth Lothlar was named to replace the constable and since that time has kept a close watch for any signs of resurgence. The Navehans have not forgotten this challenge to their power.</p>\n<p>Despite the Earl’s best efforts to keep it secret, news of the executions has circulated around through the shire. In 717TR, rumours of more “dark practices” led to a panic and the burning of three freemen of nearby Larwedin Manor. [Minarsas. Religion. Page 6.] Then, in 718TR, Smee of Koralir was captured on the roof of Caer Minarsas. On the rack he confessed to being a Navehan cleric. Publicly, the Earl dismissed the confession. Privately, security was redoubled.</p>\n<p>Sir Andro has no idea he is really working for a Navehan cleric from Tashal. He thinks his “ally”, Sir Hevan (a well-dressed, obviously noble knight), is an agent of Sir Conwan Elendsa. The cleric has convinced Sir Andro that the Earl intends to back the bastard Maldan Harabor as successor to the King, something that gravely offends the bailiff’s traditional beliefs in legitimate succession. He has asked Sir Andro “just” to pass details of the Earl’s movements and security to one of several contacts; his agents will do the rest. Sir Andro was given a list of the contacts to memorize and then burn. Afraid he will forget the names, he keeps the document in his coin purse.</p>\n<h3>Option 4 – Constable of Kyg</h3>\n<p>Sir Danyes Bernan is well connected and maintains a lavish home in Tashal. He is known as a consummate host and his events are always well attended, continuing long after the more sedate guests have retired. Afterwards, rumours of more scandalous behaviour and embarrassed apologies circulate widely among the younger nobility. Appointed constable of Kyg Keep in 717TR, he is a corrupt thieving administrator, although the Earl of Balim does not yet know this. Under his direction, Kyg has become the centre of a quiet Lia-Kavair operation that acquires herbs and fungi from local herbalists and produces poisons and proscribed drugs. Sir Danyes is paid handsomely for his protection and patronage. [Kaldor v2. Kyg. Page 36.]</p>\n<p>Suspicious of this unexplained wealth, the Earl has had agents monitoring the constable since his appointment. In 718TR, one of them was caught and revealed his master’s name under torture. Using his contacts, Sir Danyes hired a Lia-Kavair assassin to kill the Earl. Since that time, the Earl’s agents have redoubled their search for proof to condemn the constable. But, he has proved too skilled at concealing his tracks. There are rumours that he had ordered the murder of the Baron of Setrew’s sister and that he has been conspiring with the Lia-Kavair to produce poisons and proscribed drugs, but no proof. A few months ago, the Earl’s agents finally obtained a copy of the accounts paid by the constable to the Earl of Balim. Travelling manor to manor, they confirmed Sir Danyes is skimming huge amounts from the fief. Sir Declaen intends to present the document to Sir Troda in Olokand. Warned by his own agents, Sir Danyes will do whatever it takes to prevent that happening.

There are four reasons that drive this out-of-character trip: his wife’s health, the forthcoming succession crisis, his missing son-in-law and finding a suitable husband for his youngest daughter, Camissa.</p>\n<p>The health of his invalid wife, Lady Ialny, is the Earl’s greatest concern. She suffered a terrible palsy several years ago, which left her crippled and speechless. The Earl’s physician, Sir Petral, has been able to keep her alive, but he recently informed Sir Declaen that she is slowly fading away and there is little he can do but make her comfortable. The Earl’s eldest daughter, Lady Thilisa Meleken, wife of the Earl of Osel, is a great patron of the nuns at the Peonian Abbey of Erone. When her father wrote her to tell her the prognosis, she wrote back, urging him to take her to Erone’s famous hospital. The nunnery has a reputation for excellence in the healing arts and has natural mineral springs long considered therapeutic. The Earl has decided that he must act quickly or lose his beloved wife.</p>\n<p>Despite his enviable position far from the possible future battlegrounds of the Kaldoric Succession [Kaldor v2. Kaldoric Succession. Page 8.] , the Earl is worried about turmoil that could result if an heir is not named soon. He has decided to seek a private audience with the King to encourage him to act. Rumours swirl that the Earl supports Sir Erelar Hirnen (Baron of Nenda) or perhaps Sir Koris Harabor (Marshal of the Royal Guard) or maybe Sir Orsin Firith (Warden of Oselmarch) or even Sir Tulath Kaphin (Sheriff of Vemion). No one knows for sure and many parties are keen to find out where the powerful noble stands in event of a civil war. The Earl plays his political position close to his chest, though his loyalty to Vemionshire is well known.</p>\n<p>The Earl’s eldest daughter is married to Sir Sedris Meleken, the Earl of Osel, an important and powerful noble. He is missing, having gone in pursuit of a murderer. Sir Declaen is anxious for him to be found, both for his daughter’s sake and for more practical reasons. Between them, Sir Declaen and Sir Sedris control a large portion of the kingdom and could be instrumental in shifting the balance of power in a succession crisis. While his daughter speaks in his place, it is unclear how many nobles will heed her position. The Earl of Vemion has agents actively searching for Sir Sedris. He intends to personally speak with the Rekela of Pagostra about this issue.</p>\n<p>Maid Camissa is Sir Declaen’s youngest daughter, now fourteen years old. The Earl wishes to match her to a suitable husband, someone wealthy and powerful. He has spent many months reviewing family trees and considering his options. He has some names in mind but wishes to check the records in Tashal. Since the tournament is traditionally the greatest concentration of nobles in Kaldor, the Earl has decided this would be an ideal venue to study and interview potential matches and introduce his daughter. She is not very interested in marriage, but she is young yet. Sir Declaen hopes that the attentions of some dashing young knights might pique her interest.</p>","format":1},"_id":"9TwsdQTENc3pakzh","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}}],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"hm3","systemVersion":"1.4.0","coreVersion":"10.276","createdTime":1659201858914,"modifiedTime":1659201858914,"lastModifiedBy":"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW"},"_id":"1jJR0PqDGXtjve3L","ownership":{"default":0,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"folder":null,"sort":0}

If they achieve a critical success (CS) they learn 1d4+1 (rolled by the player) rumours. A marginal success (MS) allows them to learn one rumour. A marginal failure (MF) results in them being unable to elicit any interesting rumours, but a critical failure (CF) alerts the NPC to the fact that the PC is trying to solicit information and no further attempts may be made to solicit gossip from that NPC.</p>\n<p>Once the PC has made a successful Intrigue roll, the GM secretly rolls to determine the rumour origin (i.e. where the rumour comes from). Then, the PC rolls 1d100. The GM takes the PC’s roll and reads out the rumour from the appropriate origin table. The PCs may hear the same rumour from several sources.</p>\n<p>In most situations, each subsequent interaction with the same NPC reduces the PCs Intrigue roll by –10. However, there are three ways for PCs to “pump” an NPC for more information, through successful Rhetoric, Dancing or Lovecraft rolls. As long as the PC succeeds in both an Intrigue roll and the indicated skill roll, there is no penalty for subsequent rumours. Upon failing either roll, the normal -10 penalty starts to accumulate.</p>\n<p>Rumours are ranked by “juiciness”. The most interesting rumours are listed higher on the tables and the most naïve and spurious are listed lower. The source of the rumour modifies the PC’s rumour roll. The higher ranking, better connected a person is, the better rumours they will have. This is the reason Lady Cheselyne’s dinner parties are so well attended. PCs do not have to directly interact with the source; the GM may allow them to eavesdrop on the conversations of their betters.</p>\n<p>The rumours are marked as True, False, Mix (of truth and fiction), unconfirmed (Uncon) or possibly true (Poss). Under no circumstances should the validity of a rumour be revealed to the players.</p>\n<h2>Introducing GM Rumours</h2>\n<p>GMs are encouraged to make up their own list of campaign specific rumours and plot hooks using the lists below as a model. The rumours can be specifically tailored to attract/discourage PCs from taking certain actions or tie into the GM’s future plans for his campaign. By mixing GMs rumours with ones from the tables below, the PCs will be unaware of which rumours are GM generated and which are from this module. Letting a few exceptionally juicy rumours slip early on in the campaign will encourage PCs to make maximum use of this roleplaying opportunity and allow the GM to influence the direction of the campaign and/or future adventures.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:10em\">Situation</th>\n<th>Skill</th>\n<th>Setting</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Have another, my friend!</td>\n<td>Rhetoric</td>\n<td>PC and NPC are drinking in a comfortable setting.

{"name":"Campaign Notes and Hooks","pages":[{"name":"Additional Adventure Hooks","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>These hooks are date independent and may be inserted at any time as the GM sees fit:</p>\n<h2>Medical Emergency (Both)</h2>\n<p>Lady Ialny is having another seizure (perhaps brought on by the rough road). The caravan must stop immediately until the seizure passes. The Earl orders the Chamberlain to find the closest accommodation. The caravan will stop until Sir Petral declares Lady Ialny able to travel again.</p>\n<h2>Wagon Problems (Commoners)</h2>\n<p>One of the wagons (not the one carrying Lady Ialny) suffers a broken axle. The PCs are assigned to stay with it while the teamster replaces it with one of the spares.</p>\n<h2>Spooked Horses (Both)</h2>\n<p>The caravan is proceeding along normally, when a horse pulling wagon number three almost steps on a Hârnic adder. The team bolts. They careen across several major ruts before the wagon bounces out of control and tips over on its side, spilling the baggage and a screaming Goodwife Feya Harabor and Cook Taral Plair flying several yards. No one is seriously hurt, but the horses are severely tangled in the tack.</p>\n<h2>Brigand Attack (Day) (Both)</h2>\n<p>The caravan spreads out throughout the day, opening gaps between the wagons. A group of desperate men attack one wagon (probably the last one) while the nobles are away (hunting, visiting, picnicking etc.) or far ahead. They attack quickly, without warning and attempting to grab as much as they can before fleeing back into the forest. The PCs must make an unplanned defence of the wagon or rush to its aid. The number and strength of the brigands should be scaled to present a moderate danger to one wagon, but which can be swiftly dealt with. PCs may be sent to hunt down the brigands and deliver their heads to the Earl.</p>\n<h2>Brigand Attack (Night) (Both)</h2>\n<p>The retinue has camped for the evening. A group of thieves attempts to infiltrate the picket line and steal some of the horses (and any other items left unattended). An armed servant spots them and raises the alarm. The PCs must come to the defence of the camp. The brigands manage to get away with the Earl’s second favourite horse. The PCs are dispatched to hunt them down. The priority is getting the horse back, but if they kill the brigands, so much the better.</p>\n<h2>Mercantyler’s Caravan (Both)</h2>\n<p>The Earl’s cavalcade meets a group of guildsmen on their way to Tashal for the Summer Fair. They request permission to join the Earl’s caravan for a few days for mutual protection and company. There is a thief among them and during the first night, he makes off with a PCs most valuable possession. If the PC accuses the merchants without proof, it will cause very hard feelings. Word will get around Tashal and the PC will be charged double by other guildsmen.</p>\n<h2>An Update (Both)</h2>\n<p>This hook may occur any time after Lady Ialny is left at Erone Abbey. In the middle of the night, the Earl (an insomniac) suddenly decides he needs an update on his wife’s condition. One or more messengers (the PCs) are dispatched to Erone to get the latest on her condition. There has been no progress, though she seems to have recovered from the effects of the trip.</p>\n<h2>Assassin! (Both) This hook may occur any time after Lady Ialny is left at Erone Abbey</h2>\n<p>One of the Earl’s agents brings urgent news. The Navehans intend to kill Lady Ialny at the hospital. Unable to go himself, the Earl dispatches a strong party of trusted men (including the PCs) to secure his wife and find the assassin.</p>\n<h2>Pursecutting (Both)</h2>\n<p>This hook can be played at any stopping point where there is a significant number of people, but works especially well in Tashal. One of the PCs has their purse cut or small item stolen. The GM should roll to see if they notice. If they do, they can give chase.</p>\n<h2>A Game of Chance (Commoners)</h2>\n<p>The PCs get involved in a small game of dice. They begin to loose badly (or win too well), implying the dice are loaded. A fight breaks out after one side or the other refuse to pay up after a particularly big loss. Other members of the retinue will intervene to prevent bloodshed.</p>\n<h2>Homesickness (Commoners)</h2>\n<p>Few of the servants have ever left Vemionshire. One of the servant girls is intensely homesick, so much so she is not thinking straight and decides to walk home, alone, in the middle of the night. Her absence is not discovered until the next morning. No one knows what has happened to her. The PCs are dispatched to look. She will be found several miles away walking home in tears.</p>\n<h2>Jousting Practice (Nobles)</h2>\n<p>Olokand is the greatest tournament in the kingdom and knights must be in top form when they arrive. To keep their skills sharp, they order the servants to clear an area for them to use as a temporary training ground and challenge each other and the local knights to a bit of “fun”.</p>\n<h2>Fresh Ale (Commoners)</h2>\n<p>The Earl has a desire for some good, fresh ale. Of course there is none in the retinue, so the PCs are dispatched to scour the neighbouring villages in search of an alewife with a fresh batch fit for an Earl. Of course, they have to test it first. What is the skill check for riding a horse drunk?</p>\n<h2>Tired Pilgrims (Nobles)</h2>\n<p>A small group of tired Peonian pilgrims beg for alms. They are on their way to Bromeleon and have already run out of food. They are on the wrong road heading away from the abbey. Do the PCs bother to tell them?</p>","format":1},"_id":"Q5HtDlhci6SEe75w","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":700000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Afterward","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>After the excitement of two and a half months as members of the Earl’s retinue, visiting cities, castles and abbeys, home seems much smaller and more humble that the PCs remember.

They are travellers, pilgrims and courtiers. As winter comes and goes and spring is in the air, they will start to get itchy feet once again…</p>\n<h3>A Profit To Be Made (Both)</h3>\n<p>If the PCs brought back novel and valuable items from Tashal and Olokand, they can resell them in Vemionshire at a handsome profit. So handsome, that it might be worth a return trip. They have made many new friends and contacts. They know the route now, how difficult could it be…</p>\n<h3>Members of the Household (Both)</h3>\n<p>The PCs performance (assuming it was good) has caught the eye of Sir Gorlin. He has been looking to augment the staff of the castle. He invites the PCs back and offers them positions within the Earl’s permanent staff. If they accept, he welcomes them into the fold. You see, he has this little job, which they would be just perfect for…</p>\n<h3>Agents of the Earl (Both)</h3>\n<p>The PCs proved themselves adept at getting in (and out) of trouble. The Earl has been looking for “resourceful” individuals to undertake certain “tasks” for him. He has the PCs brought to him in his solar late one evening. Sir Declaen wants to send them on a “special” mission…</p>\n<h3>The Maid’s Minders (Both)</h3>\n<p>Maid Camissa is being sent to the Academy at Caleme (or the household of her new husband). It would be inappropriate for a girl of her tender years to go alone without at least a few familiar (and trustworthy) faces to keep her company. She has requested the PCs. She will be a handful…</p>\n<h3>Leave and Never Return (Both)</h3>\n<p>The Earl does not tolerate rogues or adventurers in his service. He bailed the PCs out of hot water because they were sworn to him, but now that they are home safely, he dismisses them from his service. Sir Kobar makes it clear on the way out; they have a week to leave the shire. Well, they do have all those new contacts throughout the kingdom…</p>\n<h3>A Lucrative Offer (Both)</h3>\n<p>There are those (such as Maldan Harabor) who will pay much for regular reports from Vemionshire. Nothing “too” treasonous, just reports on troop strengths, deployments, the Earl’s movements, that sort of thing. There is money to be made in the selling of information. Heck, if they are loyal and report the offer to the Earl, he might instruct them to accept and work as double agents.

However, since they hold only one manor, supporting the Earl’s retinue on the trip to and from Olokand is a major drain on their resources. If someone suggests it to him, the Earl waives their feudal duties for the year. While the cavalcade encamps at Kerk, the Earl’s huntsmen (accompanied by several servants) ride ahead to secure the Earl a good campsite in ostler’s common inside Olokand Castle.</p>\n<h3>Assassin (Both)</h3>\n<p>During the night, a Navehan assassin dressed in black and wearing a wooden mask slips into the manor house and attempts to kill the Earl. Fortunately, the Earl’s wolfhound, Wyvern, detects the intruder and begins to bark. Before the guards can stop him, the assassin grabs the Earl’s cook, Taral of Plair, and puts a dagger to his throat. When the guards try to rescue Taral, the assassin slits his throat, sprays them with blood and tries to escape. The two Morgal’s Rangers block the door. Despite the Earl’s frantic orders to take him alive, the Navehan manages to commit suicide before he can be captured.</p>\n<p>The Earl survives the attack unharmed.

The Earl would not look kindly on a PC who accused his brother-in-law based on such flimsy evidence.

He seems relieved when nothing is found.</span></p>\n<p>The Napaldy Clan are mortified that someone tried to attack Sir Declaen in their own hall. Every man fit to carry a weapon is armed. They stand guard throughout the night, but nothing else happens. In the morning, Taral’s body is laid out in the Laranian chapel and the Earl’s chaplain conducts the funeral mass.

The Taelda venerate this subspecies of black bears (known as “Spirit Bears”) and the local members of the party will warn the PCs that any who kill such a bear will be hunted down by one of barbarian shaman. If the knights or beaters corner her or come between her and her cubs, things could turn ugly. During the hunt, the scouts come across gargun sign, two dozen Hyeka travelling quickly, [King, Edwin. 1997. Nasty, Brutish and Short: The Orcs of Hârn. Columbia Games Inc.

This is no raiding party; it is a swarm of gargun, sixty or more. The PCs must fight for their lives just to survive and escape back to Baseta. When the Earl hears news of the threat, he summons all of the knights and yeomen from the region, not already present. Then, he sends for reinforcements from the Sheriff and the Lady of Paladins. He is most annoyed at this turn of events. Raising sufficient forces and rooting out these gargun will be a major undertaking and significantly delay his departure. However, it cannot be helped. As overlord, it is his responsibility to protect his liegemen. The PCs may be tasked with leading patrols or protecting outlying manors until assistance can arrive.</p>\n<h3>Treating the Wounded (Both)</h3>\n<p>For non-combatant PCs, there will be plenty of work if combat ensues. Many members of the hunting party are wounded in the skirmish. Those with medical skills or even laymen are drafted into helping treat the wounded.

Sir Bereden Pawade, Constable of Heru, [Kaldor v2. Heru. Page 30.] has also made the trip to inquire if the Earl has any news of his liege lord, the Earl of Osel.

At one of the jewellers’ stands, he spots a gold necklace that he wants to give to his daughter, Lady Thilisa. He nods to his squire who tosses a purse to one of the PCs and says, “Work it out”.

This is an opportunity to mix and mingle with the off-duty members of the Royal Guard. It is also a rare opportunity to gain access to Caer Elend. [Tashal v2. Caer Elend. Page 12-22.] Because the King is in Olokand (with the High Guard and two companies of the Low Guard), security is more relaxed. The guards are still alert and watchful; the Constable would discipline them severely if they weren’t. This is probably the best chance an agent may ever have to explore Caer Elend.

He will have the Chamberlain send out servants into the town to “relax”. Their real purpose is to rendezvous with the agents and collect their reports on the Sheriff’s actions over the last two months. The Sheriff has his own men and they will try and follow the servants in hopes they will lead them to the Earl’s agents. Reports are that the Sheriff is truly trying to reform his image.

The Earl dispatches the PCs to ride ahead to Minarsas earlier than expected. They slip in quietly, incognito, and take up positions in Minarsas, both outside and inside the castle (aided by Sir Morgal, if necessary). The Earl dispatches a second group of servants. several hours later, to loudly proclaim that the Earl has arrived in Athelren and will he home tomorrow. The PCs watch to see if anyone acts suspicious or tries to leave before the Earl arrives. They also inspect to make sure security is as it should be and that there are no surprises in store for the Earl. The Earl has several full time informants within the community. The PCs are given several names (not all of them by far) to check with. They are to report back that night with a detailed account of everything that has happened well he was gone.

Before departing Ternua for Erone, the Earl’s chaplain will lead a prayer service in the Ternua chapel. Special prayers will be offered for the swift and complete recovery of Lady Ialny. All Laranians will attend. The cavalcade will depart soon after morning devotions.</p>\n<p>Lady Ialny’s health is failing. Her physician, Sir Petral, knows it and has informed the Earl. In a last ditch attempt to cure the palsy that has stricken her, the Earl has decided to take her to the nuns at Erone Abbey (Tirrala’s Homespace). The skill of the Peonian clerics and the healing powers of its mineral springs are renowned throughout the kingdom. The Earl is desperate, but realistic. He prays for a miracle, but his hope is fading.</p>\n<p>The nuns are ready for Lady Ialny, having been warned by a messenger sent by the Baron of Ternua the day before. They have prepared a house for her plus her nursemaid Hila, Sir Petral, two members of the Wyvern Guard (who will guard Her Ladyship) and four servants. Even in her present state, Lady Ialny is the wife of an earl and a potentially valuable hostage. The Earl has requested that the nuns tend to her while he attends the tournament in Olokand. He plans to return in about one month. This will be his longest separation from her in several years, and just the thought of it eats at him. The Earl has promised a substantial contribution to the church to cover the cost of her stay and promises of a large annual gift if they can cure her.</p>\n<p>Due to the lack of suitable accommodations, Sir Declaen plans to stay with his wife’s family at Zutlin Manor for the next three days. The Earl is afraid his daughter, Maid Camissa, will want to stay at the abbey with her mother. He is concerned that “excessive exposure” to the Peonian church might give her ideas inappropriate to her station. He will insist she stay at Zutlin Manor and accompany him to Olokand.</p>\n<p>After Lady Ialny is safely installed in the guesthouse, the Earl and the rest of his entourage will continue to Zutlin Manor just a league and a half up the road. They will be welcomed with great fanfare by Lord Kaery Valador. This will be a homecoming for Page Mikha (his son) and Sir Andro (his younger brother). It will be the first time Maid Camissa has visited her mother’s childhood home.

The many servants, wagons and horses will ensure everyone is aware that the Earl of Vemion has arrived.</p>\n<h3>Unacceptable Rooms (Both)</h3>\n<p>As an Earl, Sir Declaen is invited (actually, expected) to stay in Caer Olokand during the tournament. However, because he rarely attends, no one made provision for him. The best rooms were spoken for months ago (for the King, Princess Meliem, Serekela and other Earls). In a confrontation in the Great Hall, the Sheriff has the audacity to suggest the Earl use a minor room normally occupied by servants! Sir Gorlin quickly intervenes and suggests a short recess while the Earl “freshens up”. He snags one of the PCs (a noble member of the retinue or trusted servant) and whispers, “For Larani’s sake, work something out with Kytem Curo, the Chamber Seneschal, [Tashal v2. Chamber Seneschal. Page 19.] before this becomes a major incident.” The Sheriff leaves the matter “to the servants,” and takes a seat at head table and calls for ale.</p>\n<p>The PC must diplomatically resolve the issue of precedence and secure a room suitable for an Earl. Sir Maldan is watching them like a hawk waiting to strike. The Seneschal is sympathetic and open to suggestions. This is also an excellent chance to impress Sir Gorlin.</p>\n<h4>Noble Solution</h4>\n<p>There are four suitable chambers (third floor southeast, fourth floor northwest and northeast and fifth floor Sanric Tower). Noble PCs could quickly find out if all four earls are attending, who is staying in the remaining rooms and then approach the lower ranking guests (most likely Barons) and ask them to relocate to make room for the Earl. A great deal of high-level diplomacy will be required shuttling between the entourages of the guests.</p>\n<h4>Common Solution</h4>\n<p>This year, the Earl of Neph has elected to take a smaller room on the third floor rather than “accept the honour” of using the fifth floor of Sanric Tower. So, that room is available. Unfortunately, all the furniture has been removed. The PCs must figure out how to get all of the Earl’s portable furniture up to the fifth floor and quickly.</p>\n<h4>Failsafe Solution</h4>\n<p>If the PCs fail to find an acceptable solution by the time the Earl returns, Serekela Edine Kynn sweeps into the Great Hall and says, “A spot of bother, this problem with the rooms.

I intend to consult Serolan Irin upon returning home.</p>\n<p>I have made numerous enquires as to Sedris’ whereabouts. No one seems to know what has happened to him. It is as if he dropped into the abyss. I have a dozen of my best agents scouring the kingdom for him.

Have faith my love, he will be found.</p>\n<p>I have spent the last month talking to the senior nobles of the realm, including two extended audiences with the King himself. I emphasized to him that the lack of a designated successor worries everyone, including myself. The King is the King and remains immovable. He will designate a successor in his own good time. When that will be, Larani only knows.</p>\n<p>Personally, I believe there are only four real contenders for the throne. Among the traditionalists, Sir Conwan Elendsa is the front-runner. He is wealthy, well placed, well liked and legitimate. Sir Maldan Harabor is a dangerous and ambitious man. His desire for the throne is palpable in everything he says and does. The traditionalists will never elect one born out of wedlock. Lady Cheselyne Hosath has the lineage and ambition to be queen, but lacks the charisma to draw nobles to her cause. Her financial resources are surprisingly deep and may have ensnared some lesser nobles. Sir Orsin Firith is the dark horse in this race. He is a proven fighter with a good head for strategy and some of the most experienced veterans in the kingdom under his command. He could defeat them all if it came to open warfare.</p>\n<p>The other contenders will likely back one faction or another. Sir Koris will no doubt support Maldan; taking much of the Royal Guard with him. He is well liked by his men. I do not think Sir Tulath has the ambition or support to make a serious run for the throne. The claims of Sir Erelar, Dosyl Indama or the Ubael children are meaningless without the swords to back them.</p>\n<p>The Earls will swing the fight. As always, Balim seeks to be Kingmaker.

I urge you to join me in backing Orsin Firith. I think we can count on Sir Remiu of Nebulan. Between the four of us, we control southern Kaldor.

The Chamberlain has tasked the PCs to do something (such as set up the Earl’s pavilion). The Earl is supposed to be relaxing, but soon he is hovering over the PCs, directing everything. “Lay it out facing north…no south. Nail down that corner first…now over here.” Sir Gorlin looks on with resignation. The PCs should be driven to distraction. Everyone knows how annoying he is, but he is the boss and they must do whatever he says. Backtalk or surliness will be swiftly and harshly dealt with.</p>\n<h2>Earl of Vemion</h2>\n<p>The PCs have been given another task by the Chamberlain. It is very important and time critical. Just as they are about to leave to go do the task, the Earl walks by and says, “You, you and you, come with me.” Sir Declaen takes the PCs to do some inane and pointless job (considerably below their station, i.e. having nobles rearranging the furniture in his solar). They waste precious hours. The Chamberlain will still expect their original task to get done on time.</p>\n<h2>Chamberlain</h2>\n<p>Sir Gorlin is also the Earl’s herald. However, his chamberlain duties keep him fully occupied. Any herald PCs will be automatically assigned to assist him in his duties. If there are no heralds, a junior knight will be tasked with the duty. The duties are not onerous (i.e. delivering messages, announcing the Earl’s arrival, some light diplomacy), but they do represent a significant high profile role-playing opportunity for the PC.</p>\n<h2>Captain</h2>\n<p>Sir Kobar is in charge of security. However, he must sleep sometime. As the Progress unfolds, he watches noble PCs (especially knights and senior squires) looking for leadership potential. If a PC does well, the Captain will select him to fill the position of acting Lieutenant. This “honour” means that the PC will be on security duty every night. The GM should impose significant penalties for lack of sleep.</p>\n<h2>Maid Camissa (before The Missing Maid)</h2>\n<p>See: @UUID[JournalEntry.QK1ZfRBCXd5Uc13L.JournalEntryPage.GeZXQSHNwyVfxkdt#the-missing-maid-(both)]{The Missing Maid (Both)} </p>\n<p>The Earl’s daughter is intensely curious, clever and determined. She wants to explore every location they visit. She has a Wyvern Guard man-at-arms as an escort, but she is quite talented at giving him the slip. If the PCs prove themselves reliable and diplomatic, Sir Kobar may task them to act as her bodyguards or find her after she slips away. The search for an errant Maid Camissa is the perfect excuse to enter every room in a castle. If the PCs need to get into a restricted area, Camissa might even be willing to help them by going missing on purpose. The price for her help is their assistance to go somewhere she wants but is against the Earl’s wishes (i.e. Erone Abbey).</p>\n<h2>Maid Camissa (after The Missing Maid)</h2>\n<p>See: @UUID[JournalEntry.QK1ZfRBCXd5Uc13L.JournalEntryPage.zaZ5AyRppweTFK69#the-missing-maid-(cont)]{The Missing Maid (Con’t)}</p>\n<p>After her scare in Tashal, Maid Camissa is more appreciative of her bodyguards. She is still curious, but more cautious. Her kindness and sunny disposition resurface slowly. If the PCs are friendly and loyal, she bonds quickly with them. This is especially true with female PCs or male PCs who directly participate in her rescue in Tashal. She is not afraid to use her rank to assist or protect her “friends.” She loves the idea of “adventures”. Few, below the rank of Baron, will dare even question the daughter of an Earl, making her a potentially valuable assistant. However, Sir Declaen will be horrified and furious if he discovers out PCs have involved her in their shenanigans. He will punish the PCs severely.</p>\n<h2>Sir Andro</h2>\n<p>The descendant of fourteen generations of nobility, Sir Andro can trace his family tree back to the Restoration in 406TR. He is intensely conscious of his status and honour. If the PCs fail to accord him the utmost respect and deference or question his honour in anyway, he will react immediately. Common or guildsmen PCs who talk back will receive a riding crop across the face without warning. Noble PCs (of lesser status) will be belittled and treated with contempt or, in extreme cases, even challenged to a duel. Sir Andro is in his thirties and a competent (if not extraordinary) swordsman.</p>\n<h2>Lady Milycia</h2>\n<p>The self-appointed mistress of the retinue, the Bailiff’s wife is somewhat haughty but sensible and practical. When she needs something done, she will simply order the nearest person to do it. Example: They have run out of sweet smelling herbs for Lady Ialny’s brazier. Lady Milycia spots a couple of the PCs “lounging around” and sends them out to purchase herbs that smell “like this” (shoving a handful of what look like dried weeds in their hands). She is very fussy and will send them back if the herbs they buy are not “exactly” right.</p>\n<h2>Physician</h2>\n<p>Sir Petral has served the Caldeths for many years. He is well known and respected and is often called upon to treat injured members of retinue. A member of the Aswain Clan (known to be excellent physicians), Sir Petral is an outstanding teacher and remarkably open to sharing his knowledge. He will enlist PCs who display interest or skill in the medical arts as his assistants; they will learn a great deal.</p>\n<h2>Wyvern the Wolfhound</h2>\n<p>The dog takes an intense dislike to one of the PCs (the reason is up to the GM). He growls whenever the PC is nearby and watches them closely, attracting the scrutiny of the Earl, Chamberlain and Wyvern Guard. If the PC tries to befriend the dog, he may attack (GM’s discretion).</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"_id":"xd9y6ICZUUFJNiuX","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Nebulan to Qualdris (17 Nolus)","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>The day begins with an hour long early morning prayer session (again, everyone will attend).

In addition to the nobles, guildsmen and commoners resident at the chapterhouse, the Baron, Earl and Lady Thilisa have each brought their own entourage. This is an exciting opportunity to mix with peers and make new contacts.</p>\n<p>After a light midday meal, Sir Gorlin and Sir Meathgir start to muster their respective parties to return to Qualdris. The ride takes a couple of hours. The party arrives back in Qualdris at about dusk. Dinner will be held for them.</p>\n<h3>Establishing Contacts (Both)</h3>\n<p>Social order in the Middle Ages depended on personal relationships. The legal system was slow, cumbersome and prone to interference. In order to accomplish anything, individuals had to build up a network of contacts that they knew and could trust. Even if the PCs don’t think of doing the same, the GM should prompt them by having NPCs approach them to try and establish new contacts. It will begin with polite conversation, feeling each other out, finding common interests and laying the groundwork for future relations. Men will target wealthy PCs with offers of sisters, aunts, daughters and cousins to marry off. Potential business partners will solicit guildsmen with offers of “once in a lifetime deals.” Even commoners will be besieged by folks looking to find a good position in a noble household for their brother, uncle, son or cousin. This hook can be repeated throughout the adventure.</p>\n<h3>Intelligence Gathering (Both)</h3>\n<p>Several individuals (both noble and common) seem excessively interested in the Earl’s business (i.e. How long will you be gone? Who is in charge while the Earl is away?). They are soliciting information from the PCs (see @UUID[JournalEntry.FGMeOLJquHoNOAAG.JournalEntryPage.y5qjHlvpxGDVtPuk]{Rumours}). Are they just curious?

She engages them in conversation and then offers them a drink and attempts to seduce them. The PC must make a roll at ½ WILL to remain focused. If they fail, she will pull them into a secluded corner where she will try to solicit information from them as per the rules in the Rumour section (see @UUID[JournalEntry.FGMeOLJquHoNOAAG.JournalEntryPage.y5qjHlvpxGDVtPuk]{Rumours}).

Suddenly, the Sheriff’s men jump them (augmented by Royal Guard and/or Lady of Paladins troops as necessary). There should be enough troops to make it clear that resistance is futile. They are clapped in irons and dumped in Olokand’s dungeon [Olokand v2. Paragraph 3. Page 9.] overnight. Heavy chains and alert guards make escape impossible. The next morning, they are dragged from their cell. A torturer is preparing interrogation chamber, heating up pokers in a brazier and oiling the rack.</p>\n<p>The PCs are dumped on the floor of the Great Hall in front of Sheriff Maldan Harabor. They are not allowed to speak (any who do will be gagged). The Sheriff announces they have been found guilty of [insert crime here] and will be tortured until they reveal all of their accomplices, then eviscerated and (if still alive) hung until dead (see the movie Braveheart for inspiration in describing the scene). Then, their bodies with be “drawn” (i.e. ripped apart by horses) and their heads will be stuck on pikes. Just as the Sheriff is about to declare them guilty, a reedy voice says, “Stop.”</p>\n<p>King Miginath totters into the room on the arm of the Earl of Vemion. Everyone stands quickly. “There will be none of that. Release them.” Immediately, the guards remove the chains and gags and haul the PCs to their feet. “I have been speaking with young Declaen here,” the King says, gesturing towards the Earl. “He has explained to me that this is all a misunderstanding and assures me that he will personally deal with the misdeeds of his followers.” “But, but…” Maldan stutters. “Earl, you may take your men and leave.” The Sheriff glares at the Earl and clutches his fists impotently. “Thank you, my King,” the Earl replies and gestures to Sir Kobar. The Wyvern Guard marches in and takes up positions behind each of the PCs, replacing the Sheriff’s men. “Clap them in irons,” Sir Declaen snarls. “They’re mine now.”</p>\n<p>The Wyvern Guard drag the PCs out of the hall after the Earl. They are taken out to his pavilion in the ostler’s yard where he holds a private court. “Idiots! Do you know the trouble you have caused me? I had to plead your case to the King himself to save your useless lives. If it weren’t for [insert good deed the PCs have done for the Earl], I would have left you to the Sheriff’s tender mercies. However, the look on his face when I snatched you out of his grip was almost worth the price. It will cost me later; so you had better appreciate the trouble you have caused me! Sir Gorlin, they are to have nothing but bread and water for five days. Assign them to the most menial of duties. I will decide what to do with them then.”</p>\n<p>After five days, the PCs are again hauled in front of the Earl. In return for their solemn vow not to repeat such foolishness (or at the very least not to get caught), they are given their parole and let off with a stern warning.

[Olokand v2. Paragraph 1. Page 11.] The preparations for the audience begin early in the morning. Everyone dons their newest and most stylish robes or dresses (recently purchased in Tashal and in the latest fashion). For the Earl, the ladies of his household have selected a luxurious velvet tunic of the deepest sapphire blue trimmed in gold thread and richly appliquéd with the Caldeth arms in silk. The Wyvern Guard and all of the Earl’s knights are flawlessly turned out, but unarmed. Only the Royal Guard may carry weapons in His Majesty’s presence. The chamberlain checks and rechecks everything. At the appointed hour, the Earl’s party assembles in the Great Hall. Sir Kobar stands guard over two ironbound chests with heavy locks. Each requires a pair of muscular servants to carry. They contain a large portion (40%) of the Earl’s annual feudal obligation.</p>\n<p>Once the heralds announce that the King is ready to receive them, the Earl and his party make their way to the entrance to the Royal Council Chamber. The king’s heralds announce the members of the party in order of precedence. Once everyone (of importance) is introduced, the Earl makes his obedience to the monarch. Afterwards, he takes the opportunity to personally present his daughter, Maid Camissa, and any other persons of real significance in his entourage. This is a major event for the Royal Court as many of the courtiers and other nobles have never met the Earl of Vemion in person.</p>\n<p>The formalities complete, the Earl delivers the two chests of silver to King Miginath. Sir Declaen owes an annual duty of £1200 scutage plus aids. Of this amount, £500 must be paid in silver. Servants bring forward the two chests with £250 each. Those closest to Sir Gorlin and Sir Kobar hear an audible sigh of relief when the Treasurer of the Exchequer accepts the fortune in coin.</p>\n<p>The King spends several hours holding court before retiring to his private chambers. Before he leaves, the King invites the Earl to meet with him for a private dinner three nights hence (14 Larane).

They also speak with a distinctive accent and few have any experience with the Royal Court. The courtiers consider themselves the crème-de-la-crème of Kaldoric society and look down on these “country cousins” from the “backwoods.” The snobbery quickly escalates into social combat, [Reyes, Arthur. 2003.

That evening, after the ceremonies are finished, the King will invite the Serekela and the four earls to join him for a nice brandy and friendly conversation. It is the first time that the earls have all been in one room together in many years. The King sits back and watches how they get along and the dynamic between them and the Serekela.

The Champion of the Minarsas Tournament will represent the Earl. The Earl will pay his Champion’s entry fee. Although not known as a great fan of tournaments, Sir Declaen will be very pleased if “his” champion does well. A high standing will earn a generous reward from the Earl. He has promised to match the purse (£30) if his champion wins, a powerful incentive. Other knights of the Earl’s retinue may also enter the joust, but at their own expense.

A rather dangerous and disreputable looking knight, Sir Randal Mohun, presents himself to the Earl and offers the services of himself and his men. The PCs are dispatched to inspect his troops. They look more like brigands than men-at-arms. They are all mounted with quilt armour, broadswords and spears. The Earl will be very interested to hear the PCs assessment of Sir Randal and his men. Sir Kobar does not like the look of this lot and advises the Earl not to hire them.</p>\n<h3>Old/New Rivalries (Both)</h3>\n<p>Representatives from Vemionshire and the Earl’s Court are rare at the Olokand Tournament. Several of the less cultured retainers of other Earls and Barons will make snide comments behind the PCs backs or under their breath. The GM should emphasize the bond that has developed among the retinue during the trip from Minarsas to Olokand. A strong sense of shire loyalty should stoke the PCs temper. The GM should use this day as an opportunity to build hard feelings and rivalries between the different groups. The older knights will try and keep things reasonable. Heavily armed groups of Royal Guards and Lady of Paladins troops roam the grounds keeping order. They are quite willing to bash heads to keep the peace.</p>\n<h3>Cloaked Guest (Both)</h3>\n<p>A guest arrives hooded and concealed from view, escorted only by Sir Kobar. He is hustled into the Earl’s pavilion. No one is allowed in, not even to serve the meal. The Chamberlain serves the Earl and his guest personally, while Sir Kobar stands guard. The mysterious guest is Sir Koris Harabor, Marshal of the Royal Guard and nephew of the head of Clan Harabor, a powerful and influential Vemionshire family. Many would pay handsomely for news that the King’s bastard was having private meetings with the Earl, and even more to learn what they were discussing.</p>","format":1},"_id":"J7qcSHeERUNgd7sw","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":5600000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Olokand (17 Larane)","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>The fifth and final day of jousting has only three bouts, two in the morning to decide the finalists and the championship joust in mid-afternoon.

The winner of the final bout is honoured with a sizeable purse (£30). The day concludes with the Feast of Saint Ambrathas, including a grand banquet, music and dancing until dawn.</p>\n<h3>The Right Husband (Nobles)</h3>\n<p>One of the Earl’s primary goals for his Progress is to find an appropriate husband for his youngest daughter. He has prepared a list of possible matches. He intends to meet with their fathers, then interview the potential husbands. If he likes what he sees, then he will arrange for them to meet his daughter in a public setting. Her wishes and desires in this match are subordinate to the needs of the earldom, but her father is not an ogre, he would like to find a match that is both advantageous and who her daughter likes and may even grow to love. The PCs work as messengers, seeking out the men the Earl wishes to meet and arranging times. Since everyone attends the final jousts and there is considerable waiting in between matches, it is a perfect day for interviews and meetings.</p>\n<h3>Warhorses (Both)</h3>\n<p>For ten days, Olokand is home to a massive concentration of the finest horses in the kingdom. Ostlers travel from across the kingdom to show off their wares. Also, it is inevitable that some knights will lose their horses in wagers. The winners can keep them or sell them off. There is a booming market in buy warhorses, either from winners or ostlers. Wealthy PCs may take this opportunity to buy a new horse. The Earl wants to purchase several new horses; poorer PCs (especially ostlers, teamsters and grooms) are sent to find good quality horses for him. They must negotiate a fair price.</p>\n<h3>Recruiter (Both)</h3>\n<p>There are many Laranian knights and men-at-arms, Lady of Paladins, Spear of Shattered Sorrow and even Chequered Shield present at the tournament. One (knight for nobles, man-at-arms for commoner) strikes up a conversation. He is friendly, funny and engaging, but with a slightly foreign accent. After a few ales, he asks the PCs if they have ever wanted to travel, visit far away exotic locations, serve Larani? If they say yes, he order’s several more rounds of ale and the pitch becomes more direct. Have they ever thought about joining the Lady of Paladins? Perhaps travelling to Melderyn? There are many “opportunities” for glory and advancement in the Holy Crusade against the hated, barbarian Solori. “Are you interested in joining?” The recruiter will do just about anything (moral) to convince the PCs to swear on a Holy Book and enlist.</p>","format":1},"_id":"IqlqeQATJSYJxemN","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":5700000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Olokand (18 Larane)","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>The most important event for the Earl’s Squire (Arlbis Hirnen) is the squire joust.

He has spent every dime he brought with him (plus whatever he could borrow off friends, including the PCs) to buy the most fashionable clothes to impress his lady. He even bought the most ridiculous long toed boots which the mercantyler assured him are the height of fashion in Tengela this year.</p>\n<p>The melee follows the squire joust. It is a chaotic, bloody affair with many real injuries. If the PCs do not alter the course of events, the White Team (Royal Domain) wins handily.

A celebratory dance concludes the evening.</p>\n<h3>The Squire Joust (Nobles)</h3>\n<p>As with the joust, the Earl will sponsor his Squire Champion from Minarsas. Many will be surprised when the Earl appears early in the morning to watch the joust. He will give words of encouragement and a few common sense suggestions.

If the PCs bet on their own team and win, then they stand to earn a ton of money. However, the usurer knows something the PCs don’t.

The Rekela of Pagostra is worried about one of his most important parishioners. If the PCs do well, one of these patrons may send them to search for the missing Earl. Time is of the essence. If the Earl is still missing when King Miginath dies, his absence could greatly affect the Succession Council.</p>\n<h3>Option 2: Further Negotiations (Nobles)</h3>\n<p>The Earl spoke to many people over the course of his Progress, including discussions about the future succession and business dealings. Once back in Minarsas, the Earl will need to further expand on these negotiations. The Earl can deputize PCs to act on his behalf to further develop these initial contacts.</p>\n<h3>Option 2a: Sheriff of Vemionshire (Nobles)</h3>\n<p>Sir Tulath Kaphin is the unacknowledged bastard son of the King. The Earl might be willing to support his bid for the throne (and encourage others to do so) in return for various concessions. The PCs are dispatched to gather proof of Sir Tulath’s parentage in preparation for the Succession Council.</p>\n<h3>Option 2b: Baron of Kobing (Nobles)</h3>\n<p>Sir Orsin Firith is the Lord Marshal of Oselmarch. He has ambitions of building a keep at Oselbridge and claiming the vacant title of Earl of Chybisa. Sir Declaen can offer him money and men to further those aims, but in return, he wants Sir Orsin to renounce his claim and support [insert your favourite candidate here].</p>\n<h3>Option 2c: Sheriff of Meselynshire (Nobles)</h3>\n<p>During the tournament, the Sheriff made the Earl an offer in return for his support. The Earl wanted it in writing. The PCs are sent to pick up the offer. Many others want it to blackmail the Sheriff. The Earl may even sell it to the highest bidder as “proof” that the Sheriff is plotting to overthrow the King.</p>\n<h3>Option 3: Bastune’s Debts (Both)</h3>\n<p>The Earl has discovered the Baron of Kolorn’s massive debts to Clan Rakin in Azadmere. He has decided to buy the debt, thereby tying the Baron even more closely to him. The PCs are sent to Tashal to meet with the usurers. Completion of the deal requires a visit to Azadmere.

The PCs are dispatched to establish a fulltime surveillance of Sir Orthis. How they do it is up to them, however they need regular reliable reports from inside the keep.</p>\n<h3>Option 5: The Diocese of Vemion (Nobles)</h3>\n<p>The Earl wants a separate Rekela for Vemionshire. He sends the PCs to visit the abbeys in the shire to solicit letters of support from the abbots. They are authorized to make certain promises (i.e. a new abbey, an additional chapterhouse for the Lady of Paladins, valuable trade concessions, etc.).</p>\n<h3>Option 6: The Tournament Circuit (Nobles)</h3>\n<p>If the PCs do well in the tourney, they may be invited to join a group of knights who are travelling from tournament to tournament across Hârn (and beyond).</p>\n<h3>Option 7: Earl’s Factor (Commoners)</h3>\n<p>Sir Declaen has made several important deals for wool and other commodities. He has decided he needs a permanent factor in Tashal to represent his interests.

She is not amused and decides to run away rather than marry “that horrible man”. The PCs must track her down. Unfortunately, the Earl’s squire (who has a crush on her) is “helping her” (for real this time). He is a good rider with extensive local knowledge.</p>\n<h3>Option 9: Couriers to Baseta (Both)</h3>\n<p>With the danger that a civil war might erupt if the King dies, the Earl needs regular, reliable communications with his Constable in Baseta.

The different social classes do not “mix”, rather they interact following a strict, but unwritten, code of conduct. For many Hârnic campaigns, this is not a problem. The adventures take place out of the public eye, where a commoner can mix with his betters and a noble can accept advice from a guildsman. The Earl’s Progress is not such an environment. The PCs will be in the close company of Sir Declaen Caldeth, 19th Earl of Vemion and a Peer of the Realm. Social norms will be observed and need to be enforced by the GM through NPC agents like the chamberlain, Sir Gorlin. Therefore, having a group of PCs from mixed ranks may pose a significant problem.</p>\n<p>To avoid in-game conflicts, discuss the kind of game and what the players and GM want to get from it before the campaign begins. The responsibility for making the game work is then spread over the whole group.</p>\n<h2>Single Rank Party</h2>\n<p>The simplest way to avoid the problem of mixed ranks is to create a party from only one rank. The entourage is large enough for a group of five (or more) nobles, guildsmen or commoners. This will allow the PCs to interact freely with each other without fear of accidentally breaking one of the unwritten rules of rank interaction. Unfortunately, this will also limit the adventures that the PCs can participate in. Nobles will not be able to go skulking around sewers and commoners will not be allowed to participate fully in the King’s Court.</p>\n<h2>Multiple PCs</h2>\n<p>An alternate way of resolving the problem is to allow the players to run multiple PCs of different ranks. That way for one session, they can play commoners sent on a mission to mingle with the locals, the next session they can be nobles hobnobbing with the Earl at a fancy dinner party and then play guildsmen negotiating a valuable contract for wool. This style of play is more work for the GM and requires the players to strictly segregate the knowledge of each of their PCs, but can be a lot of fun.</p>\n<h2>Mixed Rank Party</h2>\n<p>The third and most challenging option is to allow the players to run the PCs of their choice regardless of rank. Then, the PCs will have to interact with each other following the medieval rules of conduct. This requires a lot of work and maturity on the part of the PCs and the GM. Actions have consequences and the GM must enforce them. While challenging, this style of play (if done right) is potentially the most rewarding. It allows the players to truly immerse themselves in the culture and thought processes of a true Hârnic character. Players and the GM will have to expend additional effort to learn and follow the appropriate social behaviour.</p>","format":1},"_id":"ydosfyryyJuuLwdY","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Pregame","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>The Earl’s Progress begins with the pregame. The purpose of the pregame is to seamlessly, logically and believably integrate the PCs with the Earl’s entourage. The GM can simply talk the players through this portion of the adventure; however, it can be more enjoyable to actual roleplay events as an extension of the campaign. If the PCs are using new characters purpose made for the campaign, then the GM can combine the pregame with character creation. The players can integrate existing PCs into the campaign with a little work. There are several potential “entry points” into the Progress. The GM should simply select the one that best fits his PCs and play it out. Some options work better for Nobles, Commoners or equally well for Both. Options include:</p>\n<h2>Tournament (Both)</h2>\n<p>The Earl has decided to begin this progress with a local tournament. This event will be held in the Stock Common east of Minarsas Castle. It will open with a Laranian Soratir (Low Mass) on 25 Kelen, followed by five days of tournament. It will be a local affair open to liegemen of the Earl of Vemion only. Knights, squires and yeomen from across Vemionshire will converge on Minarsas to pay homage their liege and to compete for the right to attend the tournament in Olokand in his retinue. The champion of the knight’s joust, captain of the melee (also a knight) and winners of the squire’s joust and yeoman’s longbow shoot will be invited to join The Earl’s Progress. See Tournament [Gant, Bill. 2002. Tourney. Columbia Games Inc. Currently in print, available from CGI: Tournament.] for ideas and more details.</p>\n<h2>Agents of the Earl (Both)</h2>\n<p>Sir Declaen employs a network of agents throughout the kingdom. Some work for him directly, some through proxies. The PCs have done him some great service and have been summoned to Minarsas. As a reward for their work the Earl invites them to join his entourage. Their skills may be needed enroute.</p>\n<h2>Members of the Household (Commoners)</h2>\n<p>The PCs are already part of the Earl’s household; options include personal retainers (guards, specialists or servants). This works best with new characters or when the players’ existing characters have previously worked for the Earl.</p>\n<h2>Friends of the Earl (Nobles)</h2>\n<p>The PCs have become friends with the Earl. The GM must come up with a plausible reason for the PCs to get to know Sir Declaen. Hunting, hawking and wool business are a few of the possibilities. How much the Earl “trusts” his friends is up to the GM. He is likely to have them investigated.</p>\n<h2>Family Members (Nobles)</h2>\n<p>Although the Caldeth Clan is small, there are more distant relations and in-laws (Valador, Ubael, Meleken and Verdreth). The Earl may accept PCs into the entourage as a favour to their parents. This works especially well for a group of young, related characters seeking marriage or future employment.</p>\n<h2>Last Minute Replacements (Commoners)</h2>\n<p>A bad batch of meat (poisoned?) at the departure feast has given several of the entourage’s specialists and servants food poisoning. The Earl is unwilling to wait for them to recover, so Sir Gorlin quickly recruits replacements from those attending the joust. Until they prove themselves, they will be watched closely.</p>\n<h2>The Bailiff’s Pawns (Both)</h2>\n<p>Sir Andro Valador is conspiring with one of the Earl’s enemies (see @UUID[JournalEntry.1jJR0PqDGXtjve3L.JournalEntryPage.Vd4WYNCooMZMxhmS]{The Enemy}) to get rid of him and replace him with his more malleable son. Through a few “suggestions” and “recommendations” he arranges for the PCs to be included in the entourage. They will be his instruments to bring down the Earl.</p>\n<h2>Entertainers (Commoners)</h2>\n<p>The Earl does not have bonded harpers or a fool in his full-time employ. Given the length of the journey, he has instructed his chamberlain to find someone who can entertain him during the long trip. They need not be guilded; PCs with (some) acting or musical skills could be hired in a pinch.</p>\n<h2>Guild Negotiators (Commoners)</h2>\n<p>Ebran Harabor is the Earl’s bonded clothier responsible for the planned negotiations in Tashal. He is free to select additional representatives (the PCs) of the mercantylers’, clothiers’, hideworkers’, lexigraphers’ and salters’ guilds to assist him in the negotiations. The Earl wants to sign contracts for the next several seasons and no one wants to be left out.</p>\n<h2>Additional Specialists (Commoners)</h2>\n<p>Although the entourage already includes a number of specialists, a casual word in the chamberlain’s ear could convince him that he needs a few other specialists, including litigants (for the negotiations), weaponcrafters (to repair armour and weapons), wheelwrights (to fix problems with the wagons), etc. A fast talking PC with a good story could get himself hired if he plays on the chamberlain’s paranoia that something could go wrong he hasn’t planned for.</p>\n<h2>Criminals (Both)</h2>\n<p>The Earl has recently captured some high profile criminals. He has chosen to bring them to Olokand for execution. The PCs could be jailers, witnesses, victims or the criminals!</p>\n<h2>Shek P’var and Companions (Both)</h2>\n<p>The Earl has come to believe that his wife has been struck down by a curse and that his enemies might try to use magic on him. He hires a PC mage and his companions to provide supernatural protection for his entourage.</p>\n<h2>Abbot’s Messengers (Both)</h2>\n<p>The Laranian High Priest of Halaina Abbey has important correspondence for the Serekela. The Earl agrees that the Abbot’s envoys can travel with the entourage as far as Caleme. The messengers include priests and a few lay brothers and Lady of Paladins knights as escorts.</p>","format":1},"_id":"uJScEbqcDg3c0sTY","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Qualdris (12 and 13 Nolus)","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>The servants and animals have several days to rest in Qualdris while the Earl visits with his daughter, the wife of the Earl of Osel.

Once the GM is comfortable with the NPC members of the Earl’s retinue, the next objective is to plan the campaign. To assist in this process, the module includes a calendar to plot the large scale activities of the trip, a pregame portion where the GM and PCs can roleplay how they came to be part of the Earl’s entourage and then the actual trip itself, day-by-day. There are also illustrations and room for notes.</p>\n<p>The calendar is a useful tool for keeping the campaign on track. It lists the location of the cavalcade and some key activities that will occur that day. It also includes pregenerated weather and marks the Laranian holy days (shown with the small round chequered shield). If the GM marks off the days as the PCs progress, it will make it easy to resume the adventure for the next session.</p>\n<p>The pregame is an important part of an adventure as large as The Earl’s Progress campaign. This is an opportunity for the GM to logically and believably incorporate the PCs into the Earl’s entourage. There are many ways to do this. At its most complicated, the PCs may undertake one or more missions on the Earl’s behalf to earn his trust. At its simplest, the Earl might take a liking to the PCs at the feast. The end result of the pregame should be the PCs being selected to join The Earl’s Progress.</p>\n<p>The locations, dates and activities are the skeleton of the campaign. Under the Earl’s direct supervision, Sir Gorlin, the Earl’s Chamberlain and Herald, has prepared a detailed schedule for the trip. Each stopping point is planned out, travel times and anticipated dates of arrival are shown. A GM’s guide of what will happen, day-by-day, is provided. However, it is only a guide. Weather, PC actions, added GM events, unexpected obstacles can alter the plan. The GM should feel free to adjust the schedule and even eliminate whole sections if they do not conform to his adventure plans.</p>\n<p>Adventure hooks are just ideas to spark the GM’s imagination. The GM may pick and choose from them, as he likes. Some GMs are comfortable making up the details on the fly while others prefer extensive preparation. Read through the hooks in advance and adjust as you see fit. To assist the GM, each adventure hook is marked as either intended for Nobles, Commoners or Both. GMs can adjust the hooks to fit their PC mix.</p>\n<p>Extensive white space has been left beside each location and adventure hook for GM Notes. This allows you to make notes about what you plan to happen and to record what actually happens. You can also keep track of NPCs encountered, contacts made, promises to keep, relationships and important clues.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.QK1ZfRBCXd5Uc13L.JournalEntryPage.gQJdSx6aPBbRZsLe]{Campaign Notes and Adventure Hooks}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Planning the Campaign</h2>\n<p>The key to a successful and enjoyable campaign (for the GM and the PCs) is planning, PLANNING, <strong>PLANNING</strong>. This does not mean writing out every encounter or designing every building the PCs might enter, but it does mean thinking each adventure hook through beforehand. Most adventures follow the three-act rule: set-up, confrontation and resolution.</p>\n<h3>Part One: Set-up</h3>\n<p>Answer these three questions: Who (or what) is this adventure about? (Who is the opponent? What kind of person are they?); Where's it taking place? (What's the story's location? What kind of place do the characters live in?); What’s going to happen? (Something is going to happen that is going to challenge the PCs).</p>\n<h3>Part Two: Confrontation</h3>\n<p>Your PCs have a dramatic need; to find the Holy Grail, to defeat the evil empire or to kill the shark. But it wouldn't make that great adventure if they could complete their task in the next ten minutes. Conflict is the essence of drama. The PCs have to overcome a series of obstacles that you drop in their path. Let them struggle towards their goal. This section can be subdivided into two, separated by the mid-point, where something relevant to the PC’s main aim becomes clearer. Each of these two halves can be cut in half by a Pinch; a key scene that helps keeps the story on track.</p>\n<h3>Part Three: Resolution</h3>\n<p>The adventure should be on a roll by now. Everything should be in place for the finale so it's a downhill run to the finish line. The PCs should know what needs to be done so part three is spent planning and getting into a position of strength, mostly carrying out the action and finally enjoying the afterglow and seeing who gets to ride off with who into the sunset.</p>\n<p>Even if you prefer to “wing” the adventure hooks, as GM, you should at least take 15-30 minutes, think through what you want to happen, jot down a few notes, prepare a few resources (i.e. pre-prepared NPCs, generic building plans, sketched map) so that you and your players can maximize your time playing. Most importantly, have fun!</p>","format":1},"_id":"MCfNpYPRCyY4B1r1","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"y4rrosWqroRqTLhW":3},"flags":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Wylain to Hasiel (30 Larane)","type":"text","text":{"content":"<p>The Earl is anxious to return home and so takes the most direct route to Nubeth.

Use of these named NPCs will allow the GM to control the schedule of the cavalcade and give him two key levers over the PCs activities, the carrot (in the form of rewards and favours for jobs well done) and the stick (punishment and dismissal for bad behaviour).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.baX8RHPQuU7lVUhO]{Earl Of Vemion, Sir Declaen Caldeth}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.GgMrYB8MmtYjcYBR]{Sir Gorlin Faragar, Chamberlain / Herald}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.LO6xBaEkAB00gBG6]{Sir Kobar Drelican, Captain of the Wyvern Guard}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.n9qf3Ef9c9DNE8qE]{Lady Ialny (nee Valador), Wife of the Earl}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.AnK7kgrVm9fyhQwe]{Nursemaid Hila}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.l7HnmhAuc77HB8KU]{Maid Camissa Caldeth}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.Yb1s6zLdP4db0kvl]{Sir Andro Valador, Bailiff of Wynlis Manor and Wife}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.wPfYqY5QslSA1eit]{Squire Arlbis Hirnen and Page Mikha Valador}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.gUzOKxLDzyimh4Rd]{Taral of Plair, Personal Cook / Food Taster}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.coIBYrnt9vklRIhD]{Sir Petral Aswain, Personal Physician}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.rxEeVFrRbRcVdt5i]{Ebran of Harabor, Bonded Clothier and His Wife}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.0KAmdNdMlrM6DKoI]{Esar Keriel, Apprentice Ostler}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.icEAzi0jkuYTJGRE.JournalEntryPage.i6HWV5byCLQocs3u]{Wyvern the Wolfhound}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Possible PC Roles</h2>\n<p>The Earl’s retinue is large and offers many different roles for PCs to play.
