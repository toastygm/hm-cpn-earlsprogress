_The Wyvern Stirs..._

**Sir Declaen Caldeth**, 19th Earl of Vemion, prefers his remote fiefdom and the security of Minarsas Castle to the politics and intrigue of the Royal Court of Kaldor. He rarely stirs from his lair, and then only for the briefest of periods. Thus, his subjects were shocked when he announced his intention to make a great tour of the realm. He will visit his liegeman, the Baron of Kolorn and his Constables at Zoben and Baseta, attend the Royal Chelebin Tournament of Chivalry at Olokand Castle and stop at the capital city of Tashal en route.

All of Vemionshire is abuzz with the news. The Earl will host a tournament in Minarsas. The winners will join his retinue and represent the shire at the Olokand tourney. Every knight and yeoman is vying for a spot in this once-in-a-lifetime tour of the kingdom and with it, the promise of the personal favor of one of the most powerful magnates in Kaldor. Are you worthy of being a member of The Earl’s Progress?
