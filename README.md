# HârnWorld Campaign: The Earl's Progress

This module provides the campaign "The Earl's Progress", a campaign for the
[HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy setting. However, this
campaign could be located in any fantasy setting or location with some adaptations.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic, with the exception of Actors.
Detailed descriptions of the actors has been provided in journal entries to facilitate
conversion to other game systems.

The Earl of Vemion is something of a recluse. He lives in remote Vemionshire with his
invalid wife, rarely stirring. Now he has decided to attend the tournament in Olokand,
a shock to his household and those around him. The Earl’s family and friends are worried
about this sudden change in character. Why, and why now? Recently, a Navehan assassin
tried to kill the Earl. While he is travelling on the road would be a perfect opportunity
for another attempt.
