# HârnWorld Campaign: The Earl's Progress

This module provides the campaign "The Earl's Progress", a set of adventures for the
[HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy setting. However, this
campaign could be located in any fantasy setting or location with some adaptations.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
