        "content": "<h1>Rumours</h1>\n<p>Whenever the PCs are in a social situation, they can make an Intrigue roll to determine if they pick up any new or interesting rumours. If they achieve a critical success (CS) they learn 1d4+1 (rolled by the player) rumours. A marginal success (MS) allows them to learn one rumour. A marginal failure (MF) results in them being unable to elicit any interesting rumours, but a critical failure (CF) alerts the NPC to the fact that the PC is trying to solicit information and no further attempts may be made to solicit gossip from that NPC.</p>\n<p>Once the PC has made a successful Intrigue roll, the GM secretly rolls to determine the rumour origin (i.e. where the rumour comes from). Then, the PC rolls 1d100. The GM takes the PC’s roll and reads out the rumour from the appropriate origin table. The PCs may hear the same rumour from several sources.</p>\n<p>In most situations, each subsequent interaction with the same NPC reduces the PCs Intrigue roll by –10. However, there are three ways for PCs to “pump” an NPC for more information, through successful Rhetoric, Dancing or Lovecraft rolls. As long as the PC succeeds in both an Intrigue roll and the indicated skill roll, there is no penalty for subsequent rumours. Upon failing either roll, the normal -10 penalty starts to accumulate.</p>\n<p>Rumours are ranked by “juiciness”. The most interesting rumours are listed higher on the tables and the most naïve and spurious are listed lower. The source of the rumour modifies the PC’s rumour roll. The higher ranking, better connected a person is, the better rumours they will have. This is the reason Lady Cheselyne’s dinner parties are so well attended. PCs do not have to directly interact with the source; the GM may allow them to eavesdrop on the conversations of their betters.</p>\n<p>The rumours are marked as True, False, Mix (of truth and fiction), unconfirmed (Uncon) or possibly true (Poss). Under no circumstances should the validity of a rumour be revealed to the players.</p>\n<h2>Introducing GM Rumours</h2>\n<p>GMs are encouraged to make up their own list of campaign specific rumours and plot hooks using the lists below as a model. The rumours can be specifically tailored to attract/discourage PCs from taking certain actions or tie into the GM’s future plans for his campaign. By mixing GMs rumours with ones from the tables below, the PCs will be unaware of which rumours are GM generated and which are from this module. Letting a few exceptionally juicy rumours slip early on in the campaign will encourage PCs to make maximum use of this roleplaying opportunity and allow the GM to influence the direction of the campaign and/or future adventures.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:10em\">Situation</th>\n<th>Skill</th>\n<th>Setting</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Have another, my friend!</td>\n<td>Rhetoric</td>\n<td>PC and NPC are drinking in a comfortable setting.
